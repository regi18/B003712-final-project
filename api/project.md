# Backend for nhgazette
The following is a very rough idea of how the website might be:


## Home page
The home page is divided as follows (below only dynamic content):
 - Read the Latest Paper Online
   - `/articles/latest`
 - Download the Latest Paper
   - `/articles/latest/download`
 - Admiral Fowle’s Piscataqua River Tidal Guide (carousel) --> maybe change a bit this section
   - `/articles/carousel` (maybe not carousel but something else)


## Additional pages
 - Create some additional sections of the website, like:
   - page-8 (rename it to something else, like daily comments, pillole di giornalismo, ...)
   - The about page
   - Mike Dater’s Corner
   - Page to read the articles (i.e. https://www.nhgazette.com/2023/06/02/this-is-your-government-on-stupid/)

## New functionalities
 - Add a login page for users. Users might be able to access exclusive content.
 - Also add an admin page where admins can add/edit/delete papers, articles, ...
